If you want to install Nextcloud on your webspace (shared hosting, ...) our web installer is the easiest way to do. 

It does not only download the latest release, it also checks the dependencies on your enviroment and 
unpacks the files with the right permissions. After this, you will be redirected to the Nextcloud installer.
